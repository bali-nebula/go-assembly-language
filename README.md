## Go Assembly Language

### Overview
This project was automatically generated based on the Crater Dog Syntax Notation™
(CDSN) file located
[here](https://github.com/bali-nebula/go-assembly-language/blob/main/v3/syntax.cdsn).
It provides a framework for parsing, manipulating and formatting documents
containing Bali Assembly Language™ (BASM) which can then be assembled into
bytecode that runs on the Bali Virtual Machine™ (BVM) running in the Bali
Nebula™ cloud environment.

⚠️  This project is not meant to be used directly by other projects.
